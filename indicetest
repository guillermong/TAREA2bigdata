' FRANK , it flies ] ' shouted someone at Sir Frank Whittle during the maiden
flight of a British jet . ' Of course it does , ' replied Sir Frank , who
patented the first aircraft gas turbine . ' That ' s what it was bloody well
designed to do , wasn ' t it ? '
Exactly 50 years ago yesterday , the first British jet made a brief 17 - minute
flight from RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire . To celebrate the event , Mr Eric
' Winkle ' Brown , a 72 - year - old test pilot of the prototype Gloster Whittle
jet , Mr Geoffrey Bone , a 73 - year - old engineer , and Mr Charles McClure , a
75 - year - old pilot , returned to RAF Cranwell . They are seen in front of a
restored Meteor NF 11 . Sir Frank was unable to attend because of ill - health .
The Gloster Whittle was not the first jet to fly : a Heinkel 178 had its
maiden flight in August 1939 , 21 months before the British aircraft .

TEXTO N°:2
DIFFERENCES ON interest rates have opened a division among the Group of
Seven industrialised countries which some officials say may be as wide as at
any time since the group began economic policy co - ordination in 1985 .
The differing views , which will surface on Sunday at a meeting of G 7 finance
ministers and central bank governors in Washington , stem from a US desire to
see lower global interest rates to tackle what it sees as a growing risk of
worldwide recession .
' Next Sunday will probably be the occasion where disagreement on the
emphasis of future economic policy among the G 7 will be the most noticeable
of any recent meeting , ' a senior European monetary official said .
According to a US administration official , the US believes that the ' balance
of risks ' between inflation and global recession has shifted . This is
against a background of an uncertain US recovery from recession and
weakening economic growth in Germany and Japan .
' We must emphasise the importance of growth at this point because most of
the global problems . . . would be more manageable if there is global
growth , ' said the US official . These problems included the economic
reconstruction of eastern Europe and Latin America , and German unification .
In a clear reference to tight German monetary policy , he said there was a
need for a ' global perspective ' among those economic policymakers who
appeared now to be concerned with purely domestic issues . The suggestion was
that high German interest rates were keeping real - inflation - adjusted -
interest rates at unusually high levels in other countries .
When the US first raised the issue , at an informal meeting of G 7 finance
ministers in London eight days ago , there was sympathy for the US stance
from France and Italy , while Japan appeared to remain neutral in the
discussion .
However , the US position is strongly opposed by the UK , Germany and Canada ,
which believe that the chief concern of international policy should remain
the curbing of inflation , which in turn will spark economic recovery as real
purchasing power is restored . They say experience shows the dangers of
premature policy relaxation . British officials have reiterated this position
forcefully even after the jump in UK unemployment reported last week .
Their fear is that the US stance is being taken for domestic political
motives , as part of efforts to encourage the US Federal Reserve to ease
interest rates to provide a firm economic backdrop for the run - up to the US
presidential election in November next year . While the US is emphasising
that it continues to desire low inflation , opponents worry that the US is
once more raising the discredited notion of a trade - off between inflation
and recession .
